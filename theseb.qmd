# CH 4 Empirical analysis

The empirical analysis investigates the effects of monetary policy on macroeconomics variable . This will be done by identifying the monetary policy shock in the SVAR model described in detail in section 3. The data covers the period 1974:M1-2024:M9 . The results of this studies will be discussed in the next subsection to give an understanding about the dynamics of the impulse reponses and baseline to which to **compare the results of the model estimated in this thesis.** The impulse reponse functions of the benchmark model will be studied . Finally, the model will be estimated with time periods by utilizing data from 1974 to 2024. The idea is to study how the effects of the monetary policy effect the macroeconomics variable might have changed over the years as the tools for conducting monetary policy have changed and severe economical shocks. In this paper, we are interested in the interaction of monetary policy shocks and in shocks leading to convergence or divergence.. A positive long-run response would imply that the central bank applies monetary policies to stabilize the currency . Expansionary monetary policies reduce divergence in the short run. A negative short-run response would imply that unconventional monetary policy helps to mitigate economic differences across countries by providing liquidity and easing financial conditions, though these effects may not be sustained over the longer term. To test whether there is a single shock among the n statistically identified ones that satisfies the sign restrictions we consider, we employ the Bayesian procedure of Anttonen et al. (2024) discussed in Section 3.\
\
First step in estimating VAR(𝑝) model is to conclude the order of 𝑝, namely the lag length of the model. Order of VAR(𝑝) can be defined based on various information criteria methods. In this study, Akaike’s, Bayesian, and Hannah-Quinn’s information criteria are applied (for more detailed information, see, e.g., Akaike (1973), Schwarz (1978), and Hannan and Quinn (1979)). With correctly specified order of VAR(𝑝), one can find the best trade-off between the accuracy and parsimony of the model.

In this study, the appropriate lag length for the VAR model is determined based on Akaike’s information criteria (AIC). Although other information criteria suggest a lag length of 1, the AIC suggests a lag length of 2, resulting in a VAR(2) model. Despite the possibility of a higher lag length for monthly time series, this study relies on the results of AIC. VAR(12) model was run in a test manner, and no significant deviation from the results of VAR(2) was detected. After conduction of serial autocorrelation tests, no significant autocorrelation in the residuals was observed.\

The SVAR model is estimated with Bayesian methods, assuming non-Gaussian errors. The parameters of posterior distributions were simulated using a Hamiltonian MCMC based algorithm . Two MCMC chains were employed in the simulation, and both demonstrated good convergence properties as indicated by their respective trace plots, which are included in this thesis. No sudden jumps or divergences were observed in the MCMC chains. Smooth trace plots partly reflect chain convergence. However, convergence was further assessed through convergence diagnostics, ensuring that all values satisfied the convergence criteria of 𝑅̂ \< 1.10. in this thesis sample two chains (N = 2) from the posterior distribution of the parameters, each consisting of 100000 draws. After discarding all but the last 18,000 draws from each chain, the chains have clearly converged according to the Rˆ convergence statistic

# Estimation and identification

# Convergence Diagnostic

We use the R-package of Anttonen et al. (2024) which is available via GitHub (https: //github.com/jetroant/rbsvar). The estimation of the model in Section 3 required 20 million posterior evaluations (two chains and ten inner iterations per step) with 492 parameters. The number of burn-in draws (the draws to be discarded before accepting draws from the chain as the posterior sample) were chosen so that for the final chains of sufficient length (in our case 18,000 posterior draws with 10 inner iterations totaling at 1 million draws per chain), the Rˆ convergence statistic of Gelman et al. (2013) did not exceed the threshold of 1.10 for any of the 492 parameters in the model. Figure 4A.1a depicts the distribution of the marginal Rˆ convergence statistics. Evidently, with respect to most of the parameters in the model, the statistic is very close to unity. Figure 4A.1b suggests, even far fewer draws would have provided us with acceptable performance. We checked our results for sensitivit length of the burn-in sample and found the results essentially identical whether 820,00 burn-in samples were drawn\

Figure 4A.1b: Unnormalized posterior densities for two MCMC chains used to estimate the model in Section 3. To make sure the chains have converged, 820,00 burn-in steps were taken, before the actual posterior sample consisting of 18000 draws per chain before, the actual posterior sample consisting of 100 000 draws per chain. The vertical dashed line marks the spot where burn-in sample ends and the posterior sample begins.

Figure 4A.1C provides further insights into the behavior of the chains and the shape of the posterior distribution.It is obviously not feasible to plot and visually inspect the trace plots or marginal posteriors for each of the 492 parameters in the model, which emphasizes the importance of the ˆ R convergence statistic. Thus, depicts those for only four parameters, providing us with some additional understanding of the mixing properties of the chains as well as of the shape of the posterior distribution.It displays the trace plots and marginal posteriors for four random parameters, enhancing our understanding of the chains’ mixing properties and the posterior distribution’s shape. Each subplot’s upper panel shows the marginal trace plot for a given parameter, while the lower panel presents the marginal posterior distribution of the same parameter. Informal visual inspection suggests that the chains appear stationary, mix well, and exhibit smooth and well-behaved marginal posterior distributions. This observation supports our earlier conclusions of well-converged chains based on the Rˆ convergence statistic. Additionally, some marginal posterior distributions exhibit notable non-Gaussian characteristics.\

### Tail exponent marginal posteriors \### (Highly dependent on convergence)

The validity of the assumption of non-normal error terms was supported by the simulation of the posterior distributions of the model's free parameters. The estimation is based on the assumption about the non-Gaussianity of the error terms. To asses the validity of this assumption, the posterior distributions of the parameters defining the distribution of the error terms were analyzed and are shown in Figure 4.2A The median of the estimated distributions are shown in Table 4.1.

The estimated values of 𝑝𝑖 approximating 2, 𝑞𝑖 much greater than zero, and Lambda 𝜆𝑖 being near zero, imply a Gaussian or near Gaussian distribution. In particular, it needs to be checked if there is a high probability for more than one of the shocks to be Gaussian. A Gaussian or nearly Gaussian distribution would result from parameters λi ≈ 0, p ≈ 2 and qi \>\> 0. In our case, the marginal densities near the Gaussian regions are not especially high, supporting the assumption of non-Gaussianity. As noted by Anttonen et al. (2024), the Gaussianity would also be seen as wide posterior marginal densities and hence wide credible intervals for the impulse response functions. If reasonable impulse response functions are obtained, one can already assume that the errors are non-Gaussian.\

The results provide a detailed understanding of the skewness, scale, and tail behavior of the shocks, emphasizing their non-Gaussian nature. Skewness (λi\lambda\_iλi​) represents the asymmetry in the shocks, with **Shocks 1, 4, 5, and 6** exhibiting moderate skewness, while **Shock 6** has the highest skewness overall. In contrast, **Shock 3** displays near-zero skewness, indicating a symmetric distribution. The scale parameter (log⁡p\log\_plogp​) reflects the variability of the shocks. **Shock 3** stands out with the largest scale (0.9097), indicating greater dispersion, whereas **Shocks 2, 4, and 5** have smaller scales, signifying lower variability. Tail behavior (log⁡q\log\_qlogq​) highlights the extremity of the shocks. **Shocks 2 and 4** demonstrate very heavy tails, suggesting a higher likelihood of extreme values, while **Shock 3** has extremely light tails, indicating very few extremes. **Shock 6**, despite its high skewness, shows thin tails (log⁡q\<0\log\_q \< 0logq​\<0), limiting the potential for extreme events.

The analysis supports the assumption of non-Gaussian error terms by demonstrating that the shocks deviate significantly from Gaussian behavior. For a Gaussian or near-Gaussian distribution, parameters would converge to λi≈0\lambda\_i \approx 0λi​≈0, log⁡p≈2\log\_p \approx 2logp​≈2, and log⁡q\>\>0\log\_q \>\> 0logq​\>\>0. However, the results show no strong concentration near Gaussian regions, reinforcing the conclusions of the *"Statistically Identified Structural VAR Model"* paper. Specifically, deviations in skewness and tail behavior highlight the flexibility of the skewed generalized t-distribution (SGT) in capturing real-world economic shocks. **Shocks 2 and 4** are particularly prone to extremes due to their heavy tails, while **Shock 6**, despite its pronounced skewness, remains less extreme due to its thin tails. In contrast, **Shock 3** behaves symmetrically and has minimal extremes, suggesting stability. Overall, this analysis underscores the importance of accounting for non-Gaussian characteristics in economic shocks, enhancing the robustness and realism of SVAR models.

### 4 Impulse response functions

The effects of the monetary policy shock is analyzed through impulse response functions (IRFs), shown in Figure 4.1. The IRFs represent responses of the model variables to one standard deviation positive shocks. The shaded areas indicate 68% and 90% percentiles of the IRFs calculated using draws from the posterior distributions of the model parameters. the impulse responses of the identified monetary policy shock, which along with their 68% and 90% posterior intervals are depicted in Figure 4.1

\
As discussed in subsection 3.1, the impulse response function serves as a method for assessing the reaction of variables to a policy shock. The present section offers an in-depth examination of the impulse responses of six variables deployed in this study pertaining to an MP shock. Given that all other assumptions have been affirmed, the impulse response functions are capable of furnishing reasonably credible findings concerning the influence of monetary policy measures on the maroecomonics case of pakistan . The fundamental concept underlying the impulse response function analysis is to identify a shock or set of shocks that conform to the priorly specified identification criteria of zero and sign restrictions (see subsection 3.2).Before proceeding with the shock analysis, it is imperative to establish the validity of the assigned zero and sign restrictions. This entails verifying whether the data is consistent with the assumed restrictions. Since the model does not provide any statistical identification for economic means, additional assumptions on the impulse responses must be made. If the mode is constructed appropriately, the data is reasonable, and theoretical support exists for the zero and sign restrictions assumed, a shock corresponding to the identified setup should exist. In the absence of such a pattern, one can conclude that the data does not support the assumed zero and sign restrictions .In order to give economic meaning to a shock, one has to make additional assumptions about the dynamics of the shock to be named. Here, the sign restrcitions used by Boeckx et al. (2017) are used for labelling. If some of the statistically identified shocks is satisfying the sign restrictions, it can be considered as an monetary policy shock. If no such shock is found, then it is concluded that the data does not lend support for the sign restrictions. In other words, there is no fundamental structural shock that would behave as required by the sign restrictions.

The impulse response functions (IRFs) of the SVAR model for Pakistan reveal dynamic relationships among key macroeconomic variables, responding to six identified shocks: inflation (INF shocks 1), real effective exchange rate (REER shocks 2), broad money (M2 shocks 3), reserve money (RM shocks 4), external reserves (TR shocks 5), and the SBP policy rate (SBPR shocks 6).

### **Interpretation of Responses by Shock** Figure 4.1

#### **Shock 1: Inflation (INF)**

A shock to inflation results in a significant and immediate increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which stabilizes over 20–30 periods, indicating a transitory effect. The inflation shock causes the real effective exchange rate (REER) to depreciate, likely due to reduced competitiveness stemming from higher domestic prices. Both broad money (M2) and reserve money (RM) contract slightly in response, reflecting a potential tightening of monetary conditions. Meanwhile, the SBP policy rate (SBPR) rises sharply, consistent with the central bank’s inflation-targeting mandate to counteract price instability.

#### **Shock 2: Exchange Rate (REER)**

A shock to the REER causes immediate depreciation, followed by a gradual reversal. This depreciation passes through to domestic prices, leading to a rise in inflation, highlighting the sensitivity of the CPI to exchange rate movements. Monetary aggregates (M2 and RM) show mild reactions, indicating limited but noticeable adjustments in monetary policy. The policy rate (SBPR) increases in response to manage inflationary pressures stemming from the exchange rate depreciation.

#### **Shock 3: Broad Money (M2)**

An M2 shock leads to a temporary rise in the money supply, which gradually stabilizes. Inflation increases following the rise in money supply, reflecting the classical relationship between monetary expansion and price levels. The REER depreciates mildly, suggesting that inflationary pressures also affect exchange rate stability. The SBP responds with a higher policy rate, aiming to control inflation and restore monetary equilibrium.

#### **Shock 4: Reserve Money (RM)**

A shock to RM results in an immediate increase in reserve money, which normalizes over time. Similar to the M2 shock, inflation rises modestly, and broad money expands slightly. The REER experiences mild depreciation, signaling inflationary effects on external competitiveness. The SBP raises the policy rate to curb inflation, showing a proactive monetary policy stance.

#### **Shock 5: Reserves (TR)**

An external reserves shock positively impacts reserves immediately, stabilizing quickly. Inflation decreases slightly, reflecting the stabilizing role of reserves in dampening inflationary pressures. The REER appreciates marginally, indicating enhanced external stability and credibility. The policy rate decreases slightly, signaling reduced inflationary pressures and easing of monetary policy in response to improved external buffers.

#### **Shock 6: SBP Policy Rate (SBPR)**

A shock to the SBP policy rate demonstrates its effectiveness in managing inflation. The CPI decreases following the rate hike, validating the use of interest rate tools for price stabilization. The REER appreciates, consistent with tighter monetary policy attracting foreign capital and strengthening the exchange rate. Both M2 and RM contract, reflecting the tightening of monetary conditions and reduced money supply growth.

Figure 4.1 : 68% and 90% point-wise sets of impulse responses to all identified shocks. The y-axis is defined in percentage points for the M2 and RM and in basis points (one basis points is 0.01%) for the REER,INF,TR AND SBPR (interest rate).The X-axis is defined as represents time it show how the response of each variable evolves over time after the shock.The exact time units is 61 months. The impulse response on the top row corresponds to an INF(shock1) then blow REER(shock2),M2(shock3),RM(shock4)TR (shock5) and the bottom to a SBPR(shock6). The size of the shocks is set to unity, which is also the scale of the shock. This corresponds to a shock of a “typical” size. A positive inflation shock (Shock 1) leads to a sharp rise in CPI, depreciation of the REER, contraction of monetary aggregates (M2 and RM), and a hike in SBPR as a stabilizing measure. A positive REER shock (Shock 2) causes immediate depreciation followed by correction, with inflation rising and SBPR increasing to counteract. A positive M2 shock (Shock 3) temporarily raises money supply, increasing inflation and mildly depreciating REER, with SBPR responding upward to stabilize. A positive RM shock (Shock 4) increases reserve money briefly, with a slight inflation rise, REER depreciation, and SBPR tightening. A positive reserves shock (Shock 5) strengthens external buffers, appreciating REER and reducing inflation slightly, leading to a minor SBPR decrease. Finally, a positive SBPR shock (Shock 6) reduces CPI, strengthens REER, and contracts M2 and RM, reflecting tighter monetary conditions.NOW WE DISCUESS IN ONE BY ONE SHOCK IN NEXT SECTION

# monetary policy shock (Shock 6)

The **impulse response functions (IRFs)** from the SVAR model in the provided graph illustrate the effects of a **positive monetary policy shock (Shock 6)** on six key macroeconomic variables in Pakistan: inflation (INF), the real effective exchange rate (REER), broad money (M2), reserve money (RM), external reserves (TR), and the SBP policy rate (SBPR). Below is a detailed analysis of each panel in the graph:

Figure 4.2. In the case of **inflation (INF)**, a positive monetary policy shock leads to an initial increase of approximately 30 basis points, possibly due to short-term price stickiness or supply-side effects. However, inflation gradually declines as tighter monetary policy curtails demand-side pressures, stabilizing close to zero after 20 periods. The **REER**, in response, appreciates sharply (around 6%) as capital inflows increase due to higher interest rates, but this appreciation poses challenges to export competitiveness. Over time, the REER begins to return to its baseline, reflecting the diminishing impact of the shock.

The **broad money supply (M2)** contracts immediately as the tighter monetary policy reduces liquidity and credit creation. This contraction persists over time, indicating prolonged monetary tightening. Similarly, **reserve money (RM)** declines sharply, reflecting direct central bank measures to reduce liquidity in the banking system, with a gradual decline over time. This aligns with the central bank's efforts to achieve monetary control during a tightening cycle.

For **external reserves (TR)**, the monetary policy shock initially causes a slight increase (approximately 0.5%), likely due to reduced forex demand or higher capital inflows. However, reserves decline below the baseline after 10 periods, potentially reflecting external payments, reduced exports due to REER appreciation, or central bank interventions in the forex market. Lastly, the **SBP policy rate (SBPR)** remains elevated immediately following the shock, reflecting the central bank's commitment to tighter monetary conditions, and only gradually declines toward the baseline over time.

These results demonstrate the dynamic trade-offs of contractionary monetary policy. While effective in reducing inflation, it can negatively affect export competitiveness, liquidity, and reserves. Policymakers must carefully calibrate their actions to balance inflation control, growth, and external stability.\

**Figure 4.2**: The impulse response functions (IRFs) analyze the effects of a contractionary exogenous monetary policy shock (Shock 6) in a SVAR model for Pakistan over a period of 61 months. The shaded red areas represent the 68% and 90% point-wise posterior intervals of the statistically identified model. The y-axis is expressed in percentage points for monetary variables (M2, RM, TR, SBPR) and in basis points (1 basis point = 0.01%) for INF (Inflation) and REER (Real Effective Exchange Rate), while the x-axis represents time, showing the evolution of each variable's response following the shock. The size of the shock is normalized to unity, corresponding to a “typical” shock size. Inflation (INF) initially increases by 30 basis points but gradually declines, stabilizing near zero after 20 months. The Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) appreciates sharply by 6% due to capital inflows before returning to baseline. Broad Money (M2) and Reserve Money (RM) exhibit sharp and sustained contractions, reflecting reduced liquidity. External Reserves (TR) increase slightly by 0.5% initially but fall below baseline after 10 months. The SBP Policy Rate (SBPR) rises significantly, demonstrating tighter monetary conditions, and gradually declines back to baseline. These results underscore the effectiveness of contractionary monetary policy in curbing inflation while presenting trade-offs such as reduced liquidity, declining reserves, and challenges to export competitiveness.

### Dynamic Effects of an Inflation (INF) Shock (Shock 1) Figure 4.3

The impulse response functions (IRFs) in **Figure 4.3** illustrate the dynamic effects of an **Inflation (INF) shock (Shock 1)** on six key macroeconomic variables in Pakistan over a 61-month horizon. The results provide a quantitative and qualitative understanding of how inflationary pressures propagate across the economy.

1.  The inflation shock (Shock 1) causes an immediate and significant spike in inflation, reaching approximately **80 basis points (0.8%)** in the first month. This sharp increase reflects the rapid transmission of inflationary pressures, likely driven by supply-side disruptions or heightened inflation expectations. Over time, inflation gradually declines, stabilizing near the baseline by month 30, indicating that the shock’s impact is temporary but pronounced in the short term. The real effective exchange rate (REER) responds with a sharp **depreciation of approximately 30%**, reflecting reduced export competitiveness as domestic prices rise. This depreciation moderates to about **15%** by month 20 and eventually returns close to the baseline by month 50.

    Broad money (M2) contracts by around **0.4%**, reflecting tighter monetary conditions and reduced liquidity following the inflation shock. However, this response remains volatile, with oscillations around the baseline beginning after month 10, indicating ongoing financial market adjustments. Similarly, reserve money (RM) initially increases by **0.2%-0.4%**, likely due to liquidity support measures by the central bank. Over time, fluctuations in RM persist within a range of **±0.4%**, signaling active central bank interventions to manage liquidity.

    External reserves (TR) exhibit a decline of approximately **3%** immediately after the inflation shock, dropping further to a trough of **4% below baseline** by month 20. This decline may result from higher import costs, reduced export competitiveness, or forex market interventions by the central bank. Reserves remain volatile over the 61-month horizon and fail to fully recover to baseline levels, indicating sustained external account pressures. Meanwhile, the SBP policy rate (SBPR) rises sharply by around **1.5 percentage points** in the short term as part of the central bank’s inflation-containment strategy. The policy rate continues to increase, peaking at about **2 percentage points above baseline** by month 30, reflecting the central bank’s commitment to anchoring inflation expectations and stabilizing prices.

    Overall, the inflation shock generates severe short-term disruptions, including a spike in inflation, REER depreciation, and external reserve depletion. The central bank’s response—marked by interest rate hikes and broad money contraction—demonstrates a strong focus on controlling inflation but introduces trade-offs, such as external vulnerabilities, exchange rate instability, and volatile liquidity conditions. Policymakers must carefully balance inflation control with the broader goals of economic stability and growth.

### Figure 4.3: Dynamic Effects of an Inflation (INF) Shock (Shock 1)

The impulse response functions (IRFs) from the SVAR model in the provided graph illustrate the **dynamic effects of an Inflation (INF) shock (Shock 1)** on six key macroeconomic variables in Pakistan over a period of 61 months. This analysis provides insights into the transmission of inflationary shocks across monetary policy and economic indicators. The shaded red areas represent the 68% and 90% point-wise posterior intervals of the statistically identified model. The y-axis is expressed in percentage points for monetary variables (REER, M2, RM) and in basis points (1 basis point = 0.01%) for INF (Inflation) TR and SBPR while the x-axis represents time, showing the evolution of each variable's response following the shock. The size of the shock is normalized to unity, corresponding to a “typical” shock size.The inflation shock (Shock 1) causes inflation to spike by **80 basis points** initially, stabilizing near baseline by month 30. The REER depreciates by **30%** but recovers by month 50. Broad money (M2) contracts by **0.4%**, while reserve money (RM) rises briefly by **0.2%-0.4%**. External reserves (TR) fall **3%-4%**, and the SBP policy rate increases by **1.5-2 percentage points**, reflecting strong inflation control efforts. These actions stabilize inflation but create trade-offs like external and liquidity pressures.

### **Figure 4.4: Dynamic Effects of a Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) Shock (Shock 2)**

The **Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)**, as highlighted by the **REER shock (Shock 2)** in the impulse response functions (IRFs), plays a central role in Pakistan's monetary policy and macroeconomic stability. The shock causes an immediate and significant **150% appreciation** in the REER, leading to critical implications for competitiveness and trade balances. This sharp appreciation makes domestic goods more expensive compared to foreign goods, reducing export competitiveness while increasing imports. Over time, the REER returns to baseline within 10 months, indicating a temporary but impactful disruption.

The REER shock also impacts inflation, initially causing a **15 basis point drop**, reflecting the deflationary effect of cheaper imports. However, inflation stabilizes around **5 basis points above baseline** after 20 months, showing a mild long-term inflationary impact as the effects of currency adjustments taper off. Monetary aggregates like **broad money (M2)** and **reserve money (RM)** contract by approximately **0.4%** and **0.6%**, respectively, reflecting tighter liquidity conditions and the central bank's likely efforts to counteract inflationary pressures from the appreciation.

On the external front, the REER shock results in a **3% increase** in external reserves, driven by reduced import costs and possible capital inflows. This highlights the beneficial effect of REER appreciation on external sector stability, despite the trade-offs in competitiveness. The central bank responds with a **0.5-1 percentage point reduction** in the policy rate (SBPR), adopting a slightly accommodative stance to support growth amid the appreciation.

In summary, the **REER** serves as a crucial transmission channel for monetary policy, balancing inflation control, competitiveness, and external stability. The IRFs demonstrate the short-term trade-offs and longer-term adjustments associated with REER fluctuations, underscoring its sensitivity to monetary and external shocks in Pakistan’s macroeconomic environment. Effective REER management helps policymakers navigate these trade-offs to achieve sustainable economic outcomes.

The shaded red areas represent the 68% and 90% point-wise posterior intervals of the statistically identified model. The y-axis is expressed in percentage points for monetary variables (M2, RM, SBPR) and in basis points (1 basis point = 0.01%) for REER, TR, and INF (Inflation), while the x-axis represents time, showing the evolution of each variable's response following the shock. The size of the shock is normalized to unity, corresponding to a “typical” shock size.The REER shock (Shock 2) leads to an immediate and sharp **150 basis points (1.5%) appreciation** in the real effective exchange rate, reflecting a temporary gain in currency value. This appreciation quickly subsides, returning to the baseline within 10 months. The shock has significant short-term effects, reducing inflation by **15 basis points (0.15%)**, increasing external reserves by **3%**, and tightening monetary aggregates, with M2 contracting by **0.4%** and RM by **0.6%**. Over time, these effects stabilize, highlighting the short-lived yet impactful nature of the REER shock on Pakistan’s economy.

### **Figure 4.5: Dynamic Effects of a Broad Money (M2) Shock 3**

The impulse response functions (IRFs) illustrate the dynamic effects of a **M2 Shock 3** on six key macroeconomic variables in Pakistan over a 61-month period. This analysis provides insights into the transmission of money supply shocks through monetary policy and economic indicators. **M2**, often referred to as a **monetary aggregate** or **liquidity indicator**, plays a critical role in the monetary transmission mechanism, influencing interest rates, inflation, and economic growth.

The money supply (M2) shock leads to notable changes across key macroeconomic variables in Pakistan over 61 months. Inflation rises initially by **10 basis points (0.1%)**, reflecting demand-side pressures, but oscillates widely before stabilizing close to the baseline by month 50, highlighting a prolonged adjustment process. The Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) depreciates by **15 basis points (0.15%)** due to reduced currency competitiveness from inflationary effects but gradually returns to the baseline, indicating a transitory impact. Broad money supply (M2) increases sharply, peaking at **1.5 percentage points**, and remains elevated over the medium term, while reserve money (RM) also rises modestly by **0.6 percentage points**, reflecting spillovers into central bank reserves. External reserves improve by **2 percentage points**, likely due to increased capital inflows or reduced forex demand following the REER depreciation. In response, the SBP policy rate decreases by **1 percentage point** initially, reflecting an accommodative stance to support liquidity and growth. Over time, the policy rate and other variables stabilize as the economy absorbs the effects of the shock, showcasing the transitory yet significant influence of money supply changes on Pakistan's macroeconomic environment.

This analysis provides insights into the transmission of money supply shocks across monetary policy and economic indicators. The shaded red areas represent the 68% and 90% point-wise posterior intervals of the statistically identified model. The y-axis is expressed in percentage points for monetary variables (M2, RM) and in basis points (1 basis point = 0.01%) for REER, TR, SBPR, and INF (Inflation), while the x-axis represents time, showing the evolution of each variable's response following the shock. The size of the shock is normalized to unity, corresponding to a “typical” shock size.The money supply shock results in a persistent increase in broad money (**+1.5%**) and reserve money (**+0.6%**), while inflation rises briefly (**+10 basis points**) before stabilizing. The REER depreciates (**15 basis points**) but normalizes, and external reserves improve (**+2%**) due to the monetary expansion. The SBP lowers the policy rate temporarily (**-1 percentage point**) to promote growth and liquidity, with effects stabilizing over time. These findings highlight the significant but transitory influence of money supply shocks on Pakistan’s macroeconomic environment.

### **Figure 4.6: Dynamic Effects of a Reserve Money (RM) Shock 4**

The impulse response functions (IRFs) in **Figure 4.6** illustrate the dynamic effects of a **Reserve Money (RM) shock (Shock 4)** on six key macroeconomic variables in Pakistan: **SBP Policy Rate (SBPR)**, **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**, **Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)**, **Broad Money (M2)**, **Reserve Money (RM)**, and **Gold and Foreign Exchange Reserves (TR)** over a 61-month period. This analysis provides insights into the transmission of RM shocks within the monetary and macroeconomic framework.

The Reserve Money (RM) shock leads to a variety of dynamic effects on Pakistan’s macroeconomic variables over the 61-month horizon. Inflation increases initially by about **5 basis points (0.05%)**, driven by higher liquidity, but fluctuates before stabilizing close to the baseline after 40 months, indicating that the inflationary impact is short-lived. The Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) depreciates by **10-20 basis points (0.1%-0.2%)** in the early periods due to reduced currency competitiveness but eventually returns to the baseline. Broad money (M2) experiences a slight initial contraction of around **0.2%**, followed by a gradual recovery and a long-term increase of approximately **0.6%**, signaling the spillover of reserve money expansion into the broader money supply.

As expected, reserve money (RM) increases significantly, peaking at about **3 percentage points** immediately after the shock, and remains persistently elevated over the medium term. Gold and foreign exchange reserves (TR), however, decline sharply by approximately **3%**, reflecting external vulnerabilities such as increased import demand or forex interventions, with reserves staying below the baseline throughout the period. The SBP policy rate (SBPR) initially drops by **1 percentage point** as the central bank adopts an accommodative monetary stance in response to the RM shock. Over time, the rate gradually increases but does not fully return to the baseline, indicating the lasting influence of the shock on monetary policy. Overall, the RM shock generates significant expansion in liquidity while exerting short-term inflationary pressures, exchange rate depreciation, and external reserve declines, underscoring its broader implications for economic stability.

**Figure 4.6: The impulse response functions (IRFs) from the SVAR model in the provided graph illustrate the dynamic effects of a Reserve Money (RM) Shock 4** on six key macroeconomic variables in Pakistan over a period of 61 months. This analysis provides insights into the transmission of RM shocks across monetary policy and economic indicators. The shaded red areas represent the 68% and 90% point-wise posterior intervals of the statistically identified model. The y-axis is expressed in percentage points for monetary variables (RM, M2, SBPR) and in basis points (1 basis point = 0.01%) for REER, TR, and INF (Inflation), while the x-axis represents time, showing the evolution of each variable's response following the shock. The size of the shock is normalized to unity, corresponding to a “typical” shock size.The Reserve Money (RM) shock causes a significant and persistent expansion in RM (**+3%**) while inducing transitory effects on inflation (**+5 basis points**), REER depreciation (**10-20 basis points**), and external reserves (**-3%**). Broad money (M2) contracts briefly before rising (**+0.6% in the long term**), and the SBP policy rate declines temporarily (**-1 percentage point**) as part of an accommodative stance. These results highlight the short-term inflationary pressures, exchange rate depreciation, and external vulnerabilities caused by RM shocks, alongside their lasting impact on liquidity and monetary aggregates.

**Figure 4.7: Dynamic Effects of a Gold and Foreign Exchange Reserves (TR) Shock 5**

The impulse response functions (IRFs) in **Figure 4.7** illustrate the dynamic effects of a **Gold and Foreign Exchange Reserves (TR) shock (Shock 5)** on six key macroeconomic variables in Pakistan over a 61-month period: Inflation (INF), Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER), Broad Money (M2), Reserve Money (RM), Gold and Foreign Exchange Reserves (TR), and the SBP Policy Rate (SBPR).

The **Gold and Foreign Exchange Reserves (TR) shock** leads to several significant effects on Pakistan’s macroeconomic variables over a 61-month period. Inflation decreases initially by **5 basis points (0.05%)**, likely due to lower import costs from stronger reserves, but stabilizes near the baseline by month 50. The Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) appreciates sharply by **20 basis points (0.2%)**, reflecting improved currency strength, before returning to the baseline after 50 months. Broad money (M2) steadily rises, peaking at **1.5 percentage points** around month 40, driven by enhanced liquidity from the reserves shock, while reserve money (RM) experiences a modest initial increase of **0.4 percentage points** and fluctuates before stabilizing near the baseline.

Gold and foreign exchange reserves (TR) increase substantially, peaking at **12 percentage points**, demonstrating a direct and lasting impact on external stability. The SBP policy rate (SBPR) initially declines by **2 percentage points** to support growth and liquidity but gradually rises and stabilizes near baseline over time. These results highlight the critical role of gold and foreign exchange reserves in stabilizing external accounts, improving liquidity, and influencing Pakistan’s overall economic and monetary stability.

**Figure 4.7: The impulse response functions (IRFs) from the SVAR model in the provided graph illustrate the dynamic effects of a Gold and Foreign Exchange Reserves (TR) Shock (Shock 5)** on six key macroeconomic variables in Pakistan over a period of 61 months. This analysis provides insights into the transmission of TR shocks across monetary policy and economic indicators. The shaded red areas represent the 68% and 90% point-wise posterior intervals of the statistically identified model. The y-axis is expressed in percentage points for monetary variables (TR, M2) and in basis points (1 basis point = 0.01%) for REER, RM, SBPR, and INF (Inflation), while the x-axis represents time, showing the evolution of each variable's response following the shock. The size of the shock is normalized to unity, corresponding to a “typical” shock size.The Gold and Foreign Exchange Reserves (TR) shock results in a substantial improvement in external reserves (**+12%**) and enhanced liquidity, with broad money (M2) increasing persistently (**+1.5%**) and reserve money (RM) stabilizing near the baseline. Inflation briefly declines (**-5 basis points**) before returning to baseline, while the REER experiences a temporary appreciation (**+20 basis points**) before normalizing. The SBP policy rate (SBPR) responds with an initial rate cut (**-2 percentage points**) to support liquidity, stabilizing near the baseline over time. These results underscore the critical role of gold and foreign exchange reserves in ensuring Pakistan’s monetary and economic stability.

### Shock volatility figure

THE Figure 4.8 illustrates the time series of monetary policy shocks, showcasing fluctuations in shock volatility from the 1960s to recent years. These fluctuations suggest periods of varying policy activity and economic conditions, with notable episodes of heightened volatility. The shocks remain mostly centered around zero, but there are periods of significant deviations, indicating transient changes in monetary policy stance or external factors influencing the economy.

The results highlight that while monetary policy shocks appear stable during some periods, episodes of increased volatility (e.g., during global financial crises or significant policy shifts) are evident. This behavior suggests potential heteroskedasticity, where certain periods exhibit higher volatility than others. For instance, the late 1970s and early 1980s may correspond to the **Volcker period in the 1980s**,, known for aggressive monetary tightening, resulting in greater deviations from the mean. Similarly, the recent spikes in the 2020s could be associated with economic uncertainties and policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.

These findings also support the idea that monetary policy shocks do not follow a purely Gaussian distribution. Instead, they display periods of clustering volatility, which aligns with economic theories suggesting that external shocks or significant policy adjustments create waves of instability.

The analysis underscores the importance of incorporating non-Gaussian and heteroskedastic shock distributions in monetary policy research. This approach allows for a better understanding of the variability and persistence of shocks over time, especially during historically volatile periods. By accounting for these dynamics, policymakers and researchers can improve the accuracy and applicability of their models to real-world scenarios.The graph provides a clear view of the temporal dynamics of monetary policy shocks, emphasizing periods of heightened volatility associated with major economic events. Understanding these fluctuations is crucial for modeling monetary policy's impact on macroeconomic stability and improving the identification of shocks in econometric frameworks.

### SVAR Model

### Introduction to the Results of the SVAR Model

This study employs a **Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) model** to analyze the dynamic interrelationships among key macroeconomic variables in Pakistan, including the **SBP Policy Rate (SBPR)**, **Inflation (INF)**, **Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)**, **Broad Money (log(M2))**, **Reserve Money (log(RM))**, and **Gold and Foreign Exchange Reserves (log(TR))**. By decomposing shocks into structural components and identifying their effects through impulse response functions (IRFs) and forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD), this analysis provides a detailed understanding of the transmission mechanisms and the relative contributions of various shocks across time horizons.

The SVAR model is estimated to capture both the short-term and medium-to-long-term interactions, allowing us to identify the responses of these macroeconomic variables to structural shocks originating from inflation, monetary aggregates, exchange rate dynamics, and policy actions. These results are particularly relevant in the context of Pakistan’s economy, where external vulnerabilities, inflationary pressures, and exchange rate dynamics significantly influence monetary policy outcomes.

The analysis is divided into two parts:

1.  **Impulse Response Functions (IRFs)**: These measure the response of one variable to a one-standard-deviation shock in another variable, providing insights into the direction, magnitude, and persistence of these responses.

2.  **Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD)**: This evaluates the proportion of the forecast error variance of each variable attributable to its own shocks and shocks from other variables at different time horizons (lags).

The results reveal several important dynamics:

-   The **SBP Policy Rate (SBPR)** plays a significant role in influencing inflation and exchange rate dynamics, although its long-term effectiveness diminishes, highlighting potential structural constraints in the monetary transmission mechanism.

-   **Inflation (INF)** demonstrates high persistence, largely driven by its own shocks, suggesting that inflationary pressures in Pakistan are deeply entrenched and self-reinforcing.

-   The **Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)** is highly sensitive to monetary policy and inflationary shocks, reflecting its critical role in balancing external competitiveness and macroeconomic stability.

-   Monetary aggregates, including **Broad Money (M2)** and **Reserve Money (RM)**, exhibit weaker immediate impacts on key macroeconomic variables but interact strongly with each other, indicating the foundational role of monetary policy in influencing liquidity conditions.

-   **Gold and Foreign Exchange Reserves (TR)** appear to be largely exogenous, with limited feedback effects from other domestic variables, highlighting their dependence on external factors such as trade and capital flows.

    # Interpreting the Results of the SVAR Model for Pakistan's Macroeconomic Dynamics:

    The results of the **Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) model** reveal key insights into the dynamic relationships among six major macroeconomic variables in Pakistan: the **SBP Policy Rate (SBPR)**, **Inflation (INF)**, **Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)**, **Broad Money (log(M2))**, **Reserve Money (log(RM))**, and **Gold and Foreign Exchange Reserves (log(TR))**. These relationships are analyzed using **Impulse Response Functions (IRFs)** and **Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD)**, which help to identify the responses of variables to structural shocks and the contribution of these shocks to the forecast error variance of each variable across different time horizons.

    The IRF analysis demonstrates that the **SBP Policy Rate (SBPR)** significantly influences both inflation (INF) and the exchange rate (REER), consistent with the traditional monetary transmission mechanism. In particular, a rise in SBPR reduces inflation in the short term (a disinflationary effect), but the impact diminishes over time, reflecting structural constraints in the economy. SBPR also leads to an appreciation of the REER, potentially due to capital inflows or reduced demand for foreign currency. On the other hand, **inflation (INF)** shows high persistence, with its own shocks driving most of its variance, highlighting the entrenched and self-reinforcing nature of inflationary pressures in Pakistan. Inflation shocks also cause REER depreciation, implying a loss of external competitiveness, while monetary aggregates like M2 and RM respond with notable lags to inflation shocks.

    The FEVD results further quantify the contributions of these shocks to the forecast error variance of each variable. For instance, over 95% of the variance in SBPR is explained by its own shocks in the short term, but this reduces to 86% in the long term, with growing contributions from inflation and external reserves (TR). Similarly, inflation remains largely driven by its own shocks (85–98%), suggesting that external variables like SBPR or REER play only a modest role in controlling inflation. REER is primarily driven by its own shocks (79–88%), but inflation and SBPR contribute significantly in the medium to long term. Meanwhile, monetary aggregates (M2 and RM) and TR are largely self-driven, with limited contributions from other variables.

    These findings have important implications for policy. The results highlight that **monetary policy alone may not be sufficient to address inflation**, given its high persistence and structural drivers. Policymakers must also focus on **structural reforms**, such as reducing supply-side bottlenecks and improving productivity, to achieve sustained inflation control. Additionally, **exchange rate stability** is critical to managing the pass-through effects of REER on inflation and ensuring external competitiveness. The limited short-term influence of monetary aggregates (M2 and RM) on key macroeconomic variables suggests that improving the efficiency of the **monetary transmission mechanism** is crucial. This could involve enhancing financial sector depth, reducing fiscal dominance, and strengthening the linkages between monetary policy instruments and economic outcomes.

    Overall, the SVAR results provide a nuanced understanding of Pakistan’s macroeconomic dynamics, underscoring the need for a combination of effective monetary policy, structural reforms, and external sector management to achieve economic stability.
